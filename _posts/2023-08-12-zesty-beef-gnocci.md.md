I've been enjoying spending a lot of time in the kitchen recently, and have been playing around with some recipes I've made. Incidentally, I've also been listening to [_Kitchen Confidential Updated Edition: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly_](https://www.amazon.com/Kitchen-Confidential-Updated-Adventures-Underbelly/dp/0060899220), which I'd highly recommend to anyone who eats food.

Anyway, it's a pretty simple dish.

## Ingredients

* 1 pound of Gnocci
* 1 Onion
* Butter
* 1lb Beef
* Garlic powder
* Salt
* Pepper
* Habanero lime seasoning
* 2 handfuls of greens
* 1/2 cup of milk
* 3 table spoons of Trader Joe's Lemon Pesto

## Recipe

1. Caramelize the onion
2. Brown the beef

3. Chop the greens up as fine as you can
4. Combine the beef, onions, milk and greens into the pan and cook for another five minutes
5. Add the lemon pesto and cook for another two minutes
