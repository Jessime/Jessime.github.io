A company that will remain nameless (unless someone convinces me otherwise) recently sent me this email:


> Thanks so much for agreeing to your virtual on-site interview for a position in the <redacted>!
>
> Beforehand, please take a look at the comments below:
>
> 1.  Your presentation is expected to be in front of a fairly diverse audience.  Members of the interview panel are going to be there, and members from other functions, such as marketing, may attend as well.  Prepare with this in mind.
> 2.  For your presentation, you may want to begin with a brief introduction of who you are and where you have been in your career.  Consider giving the audience a sense of who you are and what has motivated you in your career development.
> 3.  From previous experiences, there will likely be questions and interruptions during your presentation.  Some questions may be general, and some may be specific and technical.  Manage your time wisely.
> 4.  Choose 1-2 projects that you have worked on in-depth and personally; you would know these projects well and be excited to talk about them.  Convey your excitement to the audience.  Talk about recent (rather than old) projects if possible.
> 5.  Be prepared to go into details on the projects you will present.  Do give a high-level overview of the project (e.g., What is the problem?  Why is it important?) . Do go into some level of technical specifics.  What have you done?  How have you done it?
> 6.  Give the audience a sense of *how* you think.  What were the factors you considered when you approached the problem?  What were the challenges?  How did you overcome them?  Provide specific examples whenever possible.
> 7.  You may present your slide deck directly from your laptop or send me a copy and I will flip thru the deck for you during the presentation.  It is your choice.
> 8.  Please install Zoom and Microsoft Teams on your laptop prior to the seminar.  We will use Microsoft Teams as default and Zoom as backup.
> We greatly look forward to meeting you!

The wanted me to make a hour long presentation as part of the interview.
The last time I made a talk that long, I practiced it for weeks.
Given that they gave me a week's heads up total, I took the weekend and put together what I could.
I'd say I put in a dozen hours, realistically.
I was pretty excited about the product and was kinda looking forward to giving the talk.
The day before my interview, I got this email:

> Good Morning Jessime,
>
> I must inform you, that your Zoom Interview for tomorrow, Wednesday, February 10th got canceled.  Our recruiter will give you a call for more information.
> Have a great day and stay safe.

The recruiter called me and we talked briefly.
They said that I interviewed extremely well, but that they decided to go with another candidate.
That's fair, I suppose.
They were looking for someone with a few years of experience working with a specific technology I had never used.
But... they knew that from my resume.

And from my first interview.

And from my second interview.

And when they told me that I needed to prep a talk.

The recruiter told me, "Don't be shy about reapplying for another position."
Thank you, but no thank you.

Anyway, I wanted to share my presentation somewhere, so I guess I'll share it here.
