## Is

I have spent the past month and a half marketing a Python for Bioinformatics course I created during grad school. I wanted to launch quickly while it was still late spring and people were sheltering in place. That meant things happened very quickly. This was my first venture into the sales/advertising/marketing world, and it's been nothing short of a rollercoaster. There were high points where I was convinced a large number of students were going to register soon and low points where I made mistakes or just was down about the process in general.

For context, the course is live and very hands-on. The class size goal was somewhere between 10 and 20 students.

I scratched out some notes for what was going to be a long and detailed blog post about the adventure. After reading over the notes, I realized the tone fits remarkably well with my current mood when thinking about marketing. So, here are the raw notes instead.

### What happened

Decide to focus marketing efforts on Reddit and HackerNews, the two communities I know best. Submit pre-enrollment announcement posts to a handful of subreddits and HN. Almost all of them go unnoticed, except the post on r/bioinformatics, which takes off. Generates ~40 account creations! After ~24h, it's taken down. Apparently mods had recently decided on no self-promotion. They add the rule shortly after taking down the post. There's nothing I can do, so I move on.

Write a couple of content marketing pieces. They're pretty solid and high-effort. Post them in appropriate places but there's little engagement. Flounder a bit over the next week or so. Try to find "bio"-related places to share links. Try using my first Twitter account. Try targeting individuals on Reddit I find when searching recent "learn bioinformatics" results. Mostly crickets; get a couple more pre-enrollment accounts created.

Finally get payments working. Of the ~40 accounts created, 3 purchase the course. A little unexpected given there was zero incentive to create an account unless you were interested in purchasing the course. Low on ideas for free advertising at this point, and also frustrated by the recent experience of figuring out payments. Quickly pop out a ranty, semi-clickbait article about it. The thing explodes. Number 1 on HN. 1000s of visitors. Several account creations. And...still no more enrollments.

Test out paid advertising for the first time by spending $100 on LinkedIn ad. Generates 21 clicks. About this time, I get a 4th enrollment. Assume it's from LinkedIn but didn't properly set up tracking so have to ask student. Turns out they found us through a random tweet from several weeks ago. I had responded to someone else saying they were trying to learn bioinformatics. A perfect example of: "Random, but okay."

Success of HN post encourages more content marketing efforts. Produce 2-3 more high-effort articles. Basically no engagement. Really struggle with the fact that the sole known location of potential clients has banned anything that "might allow you to get paid".

On the other hand, happy to learn that an MDPhD student is interested in the course. So much so that she reached out to her program director. A couple of listserv emails were sent out which received "almost 200 questions". Program director has even mentioned having me give a talk and student thinks she might be able to get PI to pay for course. I get (over-ambitious?) excited and suggest videoing with student and program director. Student declines offer, citing professional boundaries and "chain of command" issues. Says she'll compile email inquires for me and forward them, but never follows through.

A friend gives me the contact info of the program directors of the top 30 MDPhD programs. Send out cold emails, which was terrifying for some reason and only happened after much procrastination. Two reply back positively and saying they'll distribute. Currently no followup data available there. Other directors don't respond.

Spend quite a bit of effort creating 3 Facebook ads. Iterate through a number of creatives, trying out a number of different backgrounds, texts, logos, text placements, etc. _After_ uploading to Facebook, get a warning that images with text are down-prioritized. Makes sense in retrospect, but would have been nice to know about a couple days earlier.

Here are the three ads:

Of course the one with the plain purple background gets **80% of the engagement**! Would love to know what the rationale behind that is.
