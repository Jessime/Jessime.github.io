I gave a talk at Resbaz today and just wanted to publish the slides to see how they'd look embedded as an iframe.

The slides are probably a little hard to get value from on their own, but there's a little more content in the speaker notes. 

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRkfUwD9p8dyzlLWL4bAZ5N6SSiOtNlLshutZdgL6xsT95kum0vSKSR4r8bwhh689VxQHL7JyOZAARH/pubembed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000" frameborder="0" width="1440" height="839" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

Maybe one day I'll write these thoughts up more completely.
