## 

1. Think about what you want to say. This sounds obvious, but I mention it because I've found that if I know I need to write something in advance, I'll have it floating around in the back of my head, and suddenly important points will make their way to the forefront while showering or drifting off to sleep. To rephrase, give yourself plenty of time. Rushed writing is bad writing.
2. Grab a notebook and write down sentences. Even in a word processor, a computer has too many distractions. Use paper. It provides the least path of resistance to saving a thought. It's amazing how quickly I'll have the structure of a sentence in my head, start to type it out, notice some red squiggles under a word, correct the spelling, and forget the sentence structure I had just been excited about. Use paper.
  * When you write down these sentence (many of them will be the ones you thought of in the shower during step 1), leave space between them, as they're likely disconnected or poorly fleshed out thoughts.
3. After you've gotten these "primary thoughts" on a page, take a second pass at them. Write as much as you can about each one. This might be as little as an additional sentence, or as much as a long paragraph.
