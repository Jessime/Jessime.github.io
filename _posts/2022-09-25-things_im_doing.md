Sometimes, though certainly not always, I worry that I've over indexed my identity on my career. Lately, this feeling, combined with my tendency to allow my free time to be significantly influenced by those around me, has led me to feel that I don't have many hobbies that are _mine_. I've been intentional over the last month at trying some new things and generally doing my own thing with my free time. Here's a quick list of some of the things I've been doing on an approximately weekly basis:

1. Yoga at YogaOasis
2. Hacky Hour at Snakes and Lattes
3. Walking while listening to audiobooks 
4. Walking while talking to friends and family
5. Journaling
6. Ultimate Frisbee (it's been so long!)
7. Football, whenever we have a group
8. Researching project ideas
9. Home improvements

If I imagine _someone else_ doing this list, it sounds pretty fulfilling! I'm happy with where I'm at. At the same time, I have a few more things I could see myself doing more and/or want to try in the near future:

1. Kickboxing
2. Acro yoga, even if I'm not flexible enough
3. Climbing (I miss it!)
4. Wood working, specifically to build some things for the office
5. An actual programming project (library time?)

Even though I've felt some pressure to keep my calendar full, I refuse to over do it. I want flexability. I want the space for creativity. I need the time for rest.
