For anyone who's curious how the survey is going, below is the current average with error bars showing one standard deviation.<br />

I didn't bother with any t-tests, but I'm pretty sure that these aren't significantly different...<br />
<br />
The survey was still a success, however. I received a large amount of advice that I should write whatever I want and focus on what interests me. So, that's exactly what I'm going to do. A big thanks to everyone who took the time to take the survey.<br />

Be sure to stay tuned!
