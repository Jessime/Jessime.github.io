For those of you who don't program, it may be hard to understand just how slow a process it usually is. Movies and other media don't help this misunderstanding. As Mark Zuckerberg put it, "If they were really making a movie, it would have been of me, sitting at a computer coding for two hours straight". Similarly, here's a <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/Kgz562w" target="_blank">visual representation of the difference</a>.<br />
<br />
Every once is a while though, it's actually useful to be able to throw together a quick script, or to generate a plot while you're having a discussion with your colleague. It's not something I'm particularly skilled at since I don't do it much. So is there some fun way to practice coding quickly?<br />
<br />
Let's make a bot battle competition!<br />
<br />
I wanted this to be a pretty straightforward weekend project, so I decided to stick with a simple game that I love a lot. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi" target="_blank">Reversi</a>, also known as Othello is a great game that even little kids can easily understand. The game itself hasn't been solved though, so it's far from trivial. It's the perfect game for this sort of project.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to run through all of the code or anything, but the <a href="https://github.com/Jessime/bot_battle" target="_blank">repo is available</a> if you want to try it out yourself. A more detailed explanation of how to run the code is there, as well as the general rules of the game. If you don't feel like playing yourself, here's a <u>quick</u> clip of what a Series might look like:<br />

If you have any suggestions or need help setting up the game, just let me know!<br />
