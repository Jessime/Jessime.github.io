## Illustrating a use case for the Louvain algorithm

Explaining domain topics to someone far outside that domain is an activity that's as challenging as it is enriching. How do you tell someone who struggles with concepts like copy/paste how programming works? Can you explain to someone who hasn't taken a biology class in decades why a long non-coding RNA is interesting? If your friend randomly came across the Louvain algorithm in a blog post, but doesn't know what a graph is, what do you say?

The last of these examples happened to me recently. My friend Sherry messaged me a screenshot of a blog post:

and said:

> this seems very cool, iâ€™d like to understand how he did this

What a random, happy coincidence. I'd heavily relied on the Louvain algorithm throughout grad school. Sherry's primarily non-technical but infinitely curious, so I decided to try to tackle a ground-up illustration of the algorithm. Here's a cleaned up and slightly expanded recounting of the illustration.

### What if you're leading the Covid-19 response team?

I wanted to begin the explanation with a motivating example for situations in which Louvain might be applied. Given that Covid is what's on everyone's minds at the moment, it seemed appropriate.

> Imagine you're leading the Covid-19 response team. Trump comes up to you and says: "Hey. We've just secured the funds to hire between 10,000-100,000 Community Liaisons. Each of these Liaisons will represent a group of Americans who are likely to transmit coronavirus to one another. You need to figure out which people are most likely to give coronavirus to which people, and make sure that each American has one and only one Community Liaison representative." What do you do?

This example isn't perfectly realistic, so allow a little creative license here. It's relevant and easy to understand.

The problem _does_ have a number of layers though, so let's start to disentangle them. The very first thing that needs to happen is to come up with some way of deciding the likelihood that a single individual could transmit coronavirus to another individual. There are a number of factors that could go into this:

* How close do the two people live to one another? Two people living on the opposite sides of the country are _unlikely_ to come in contact.
* Do they call each other? My parents and I live in separate states, but I'm more likely to visit them than a majority of my neighbors.
* Do they frequent the same public locations? Even neighbors might never see each other if they have different jobs, different hobbies, etc.
* Are they friends on social media? Friends are much more likely to spend time together than two random people.
* Do they work together?

There are many other questions you could ask. I'm not going to dive into any specifics of how to create this score, but you can imagine that you could use questions like the ones listed above to give each person a long list of probabilities (>300M of them, each between 0 and 1) of giving coronavirus to every other American.

At this point, you can also imagine that we have an enormous Excel spreadsheet. The name of all 300M people is both the first row for all rows, and first column for all columns. Every other cell is fill with the transmission likelihoods we just described.

### Network visualization

If you're familiar with this stuff, all I've said so far is:

> Imagine you have an adjacency matrix representing a graph of all Americans.

If you're not familiar with this stuff, then the above sentence likely doesn't mean much. But a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) is the mathematical term for the concept we're building. Graphs are also interchangeably known as networks. Networks are often visualized as a collections of circles and lines:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/g1.png" alt="Example graph" %}

Or maybe like this:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/g2.png" alt="Another graph" %}

In these images, each of the circles is called a "node". Generally in graphs, they represent a _noun_ (in our example, people). Similarly, each of the lines between the edges is called an "edge" and represents a _relationship_ between the nodes (in our example, likelihood of transmission).

**Note:** The location of the nodes in a network visualizations may or may not convey any information. Sometimes they're placed at random, sometimes the closer two nodes are to each other, the stronger their relationship is. It depends on the visualization. For the purposes of our example, it's important to clarify that a visualization of nodes representing people would have no relationship to the geographic location of that person.

### We have a graph. Now what?

Going back to our hypothetical task, we want to hire Liaisons where:

> Each of these Liaisons will represent a group of Americans who are likely to transmit coronavirus to one another.

Now that we have a graph, we need to find our groups, or communities, of people who are likely to transmit to each other, and therefore should be represented together by a new Liaison. How do we do this?

Looking back at the second of the examples graphs above, it might be tempting to say, "Let's visualize the graph so that the more likely two people are to transmit, the closer they are in the image." Then we can just draw circles around our communities.

At first glance, this isn't a terrible idea. At least, until you realize that:

1. You need to visualize 300M nodes, not a few thousand like the example
2. You'd need a way to draw the 10,000-100,000 circles
3. Most importantly, even the algorithms that draw the graph visualization where _visual_ distance is representative of _relationship_ distance, those algorithms are estimates and often sub-optimal.

### thank you louvain for your algorithm

Finally, this is where Louvain comes in. The Louvain algorithm will take your "giant Excel spreadsheet", and will describe the communities within that data so that we can find groups of virus transmitters.

How Louvain works exactly will be left to Part II. Most importantly, we now have a framework for when and why we would use the algorithm in the first case, and the type of data on which it might be useful.

Stay tuned for Part II!

(Closing fun fact: Louvain is named after the [University of Louvain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universit%C3%A9_catholique_de_Louvain), not a person).
