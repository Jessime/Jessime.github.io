Today in lab meeting, during our bi-weekly "Idea Potluck", I dropped the ball while explaining how perceptrons work. We were running short on time, so I rushed and straight-up got flustered. It was unfortunate, since perceptrons are really cool, and Wikipedia has a great example (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron" target="_blank">here</a>).<br />
<br />
To over compensate, I've written a tutorial to go along with the Wikipedia example.<br />

<br />
The example and the code are really straightforward, so check it out!<br />

Cheers!
