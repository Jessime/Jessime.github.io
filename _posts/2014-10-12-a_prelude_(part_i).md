Clue!

Oh boy! You found a clue in all this text! Before I set our scene and give you the first puzzle, let me take a just a few more words for some additional tips. There's a theme to this hunt and a few tools that will be indispensable. First, Google will always be your friend. For most of us, it's our portal to the internet and therefore a portal for answers when we need information or don't know how to do stuff. You'll likely encounter both cases shortly. Second, if you're feeling ambitious at the moment, try downloading Python, my language of choice. It definitely isn't necessary, but it might help a bit in the long run. Third, strike a balance between thinking for a while and taking breaks. This hunt is meant to be difficult and take some time, but staring at the same problem too long is often unfruitful. Lastly, keep in mind that in this case there's nothing off limits and no way to cheat. Get the answers to these clues however you can. That's the point. 

Anyway, I lied slightly when I said you were an Agent. You're currently a Novice, about to graduate from the academy. It's the morning of your last final, Biology 410. You switch on the daily announcements as you start getting ready for the day. While putting on your uniform, you hear the international portion of the announcements inform you that there are celebrations in Korea today, as the nations of North and South Korea finally reunited last night. Next door, however, another outbreak of MRSA has appeared in Russia, which continues to concern the international community. You think to yourself that you should consider paying more attention to the global news, since you didn't know the Koreans were considering merging. The MRSA situation you were well aware of, since there have been deadly cases near you as well. As you pack your backpack to head out the door, the announcements end by reminding you that next weekend is graduation. Everyone is invited to attend "the initiation of the government's next class of premier Agents". 

You stop by the dining hall and meet up with your friend Kevin. You both get a bowl of whole grain cereal and some strawberries, kindly provided by the National Food Committee. Current class grades for Biology 410 were released last night, so you do a quick calculation to realize you'll need to receive a perfect score on this exam, including the bonus question, to get the grade you want. The two of you go over all of your notes one last time then head over to the exam room. You make your way through the regular portion of the exam, fairly confident that you haven't missed any. The bonus question is below; answer it to continue. 


Bonus: Wikipedia is an excellent source of information. Sometimes we can link hop (start from a page and follow hyperlinks from one page to another) to find information on whatever subject we're researching. That's what we're going to try. Go to: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell

Now, find the answers to these statements to move to the next link/clue. The letter at the end of each clue will be used as a variable to represent the answer to the current clue in the following clue.
1. These types of stem cells can be made in the lab from odd parts of the body. (X)
2. X are naturally made by this process. (Y)
3. Y is mostly accomplished by getting rid of this. (Z)
4. In mammals, changes in Z are often not as critical as changes to this protein structure. (W)
5. W is a major part of this, and can make it loose or tight. (V)
6. Congratulations, by finding V, you know the answer.

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Since there are multiple motivations for this blog, there are likely going to be several themes going on at once and different paths that the blog might take in the long term. So I think it might be helpful for everyone, myself included, if as an introductory post (or two) I spell out why I am doing a blog and what I think it's going to be about.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br />
The simplest reason I want to do this is because it seems enjoyable and a non-stressful outlet for some creativity and expression. I like to believe that I spend a decent amount of time thinking about things and being reflective; sometimes it's helpful to write your thoughts down, right? That's more or less the point of a blog. My other motivations are a bit more complicated...</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br />
22 is a really strange age in the American school/work system. If you have followed a "standard" education path, you have just graduated with a Bachelor's and you're supposed to go into the real world.&nbsp;After graduation, you're suddenly dumped into the "working adult" category where you're considered the same as everyone from age 22 to 65-ish. In college, a large majority of the people you associate with&nbsp;are other university students, following similar study schedules, living on or near campus, and likely between the ages of 18 and 22.&nbsp;I've escaped or postponed this transition to "working adult" to some degree by entering graduate school, but I haven't successfully avoided the "<i>So what do you do?</i>" question commonly associated with getting to know people. In college, when someone asks your major, you tell them, they nod, and you have a conversation whose length is directly proportional to the similarity of their major. The official title of my Ph.D. program is Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB). So I generally tell people that, "<i>I'm getting my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics.</i>" And as often as not they respond, "<i style="font-weight: bold;">Um...&nbsp;What is Bioinformatics?</i>"</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br />
This is a rather interesting phenomenon, which I hadn't considered before entering the field. If I had stayed in Chemistry, for example, people can think back to their high school chemistry class and recall that I do something with atoms. In one sense, you still haven't given them any actual information about what you do, but at least they know the word chemistry, and can nod in acknowledgement. Even with Biochemistry, people grasp that it is the combination of Biology and Chemistry, and move on. Bioinformatics leaves them at a loss though.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br />
I'm not implying that these people are stupid or ignorant. In fact, as a whole I'm&nbsp;referring&nbsp;to intelligent and well educated individuals. I'm just in a new, oddly-named field. Here are the advanced degrees offered by UNC:</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br />
http://gradschool.unc.edu/academics/degreeprograms/</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br />
The only major I don't have some idea about simply based on the name is&nbsp;<a href="http://gradschool.sites.unc.edu/periodontology/" style="color: #669acc; line-height: 18.2083988189697px; outline: 0px;" target="buffer">Periodontology</a>... (If anyone reading this is studying periodontology, I feel you.) At least for the other ~100 degrees, you don't have to start from the groundwork every time you want to tell people what you do. I understand that you go to graduate school to become particularly specialized in a field. But I don't think that implies that the field itself should be so specialized that it's unknown.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br />
More importantly, the reason that I chose to study BCB is because I firmly believe the field is primed and ready to dictate the course of society in the coming century. Think about how computers have integrated themselves into all aspects of our daily lives over the last 50 years. Biology is going to do the same, because of the degree of control over biology provided to us by bioinformatics. I may be wrong, but I would assume that in 1950, virtually nobody knew the term Computer Science. It wasn't their fault. They were used to "computers" being humans who did calculations.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br />
The point, then, is that I am writing this blog because I believe that Bioinformatics is a field that is important enough that it should be at least known to everyone. Furthermore, it is up to the scientist and students of the field to ensure that the public have a decent and accurate knowledge of what we do and how it effects them. I don't think scientists as a group have a great history of communication, but communication and conversation are going to become ever more important as technology becomes more pervasive.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br />
Lastly, just graduating means that your friends for the last four years have dispersed across the country (or even the entire world). So you get to try to keep up with them, while making new friends, and finding time to call home once a week. For any of you who what to check in on what I'm up to recently, hopefully this can be a place you can visit. Graduate school is already living up to its promise of keeping me extremely busy, so my current plan is to post once a week on the weekends. Next week I'll share some of the ideas for the blog and what I want to talk about.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br />
Cheers. </span>
